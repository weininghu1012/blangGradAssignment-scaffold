# Class ExhaustiveDebugRandom()

First create variables:
- oldDecision
- newDecison
- oldDeepestIncrementableBranch
- newDeepestIncrementableBranch
- currentDepth
- hasNext
- pr

Create a long variable called serialVersionUID to make sure if the object is eing serialized and deserialized, it could check back the initial


Construct the ExhaustiveDebugRandom object by call the Random Class and pass a seed (1)

## nextBernoulli() method:
In this method, a double value p is passed as the parameter for generating the next Bernoulli value

## nextCategorical() method
In this method,  



## effectiveProbabilities() method
Given a generated double array of probability, create a empty list of integer and add all the index from probabilities where its corresponding probability is larger than 1
